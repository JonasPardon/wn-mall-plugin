# Mall Winter CMS Plugin

Welcome to the official documentation of the **Mall** plugin, the all-inclusive e-commerce solution
for the Laravel-based WinterCMS. 

On the following pages you will find all the information you need to install the plugin on your 
website and integrate it in your used theme. You will also read about the individual models, 
controllers and how you can extend them to integrate your own functions.

> [!NOTE]
> If you think, that some details are missing or not sufficiently well explained, we invite you to 
> extend and add this to our documentation. For this case you will find an "Edit this page on GitHub" 
> link at the bottom of each page, which brings you to the corresponding markdown file in our Github 
> repository. Thanks for your help!


## Requirements

We highly recommend using the latest WinterCMS v3 and PHP v8 versions available, however, the 
following requirements represent the minimum needed to run Mall on your website.

- WinterCMS v1.2+ | v1.3+
- PHP v8.1+
- MySQL v5.7+ | v8.0+ **`or`** MariaDB v10.2+ **`or`** SQLite<span style="color: red;">**\***</span> v3.19+

> [!CAUTION]
> <span style="color: red;">**\***</span> Although it is possible to use Mall via SQLite, we 
> strongly recommend using one of the other database systems, especially on a large number of 
> products or customers.
